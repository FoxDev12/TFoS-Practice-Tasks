# ETH BANK

## Requirements : 
    - The contract MUST inherit the given interface and must NOT implement any other external functions.
 
## Caveats : 
    - Is it possible to send ETH to any address? 
    - What happens if i just send ETH to the contract, without calling deposit? 
  
##  Optional upgrades : 
    - Use the other interface provided
    - Implement the possibility of having multiple accounts per address (you're allowed to modify the interface for this)
    - Make it so any call to the contract NEVER reverts, no matter what you do.
